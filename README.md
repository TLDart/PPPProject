  * Generates a custom trip 
  * Search the PDI database
  * Exit the program
3. If the user chooses to edit personal info:
  * Change Username
  * Change Password;
  * Change FullName;
  * Change Address;
  * Change Birthdate;
  * Change Phonenumber;
4. If the user chooses to list Interest Points;

  * List by popularity;
5. If the user chooses to generate a Trip:
  * Generates a trip based on the user preferences;
6. If the user chooses to Search the Interest Point Database:
